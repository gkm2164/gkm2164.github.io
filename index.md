### SMARDI, Suwon-si, Republic of Korea
2011.09 ~ 2012.04

* **Part Time Developer**, SMARDI, 
  * Developed library for a device that communicates with android devices through the audio connector. The devices send a set of different tones as a packet and the library analyzes the frequency of the packet and converts it to actual data. Other communication modules are reliable, but they are  expensive for massive production. The company developed a cheap and simple communication module that  was deployed by SMARDI on April 2012.
  * Developed an application for measuring alcohol concentration in breath, which was named A-Scan. This application uses an external device that is connected through the audio connector. The application gathers concentration of alcohol in breath from the device connected to the audio connector and analyzes  the collected data. This application  was successfully deployed to SMARDI on December 2011.

     * The website is based on PHP and was developed under several important design patterns, such as MVC, Layered architecture. Every service is dealt with object that is instantiation of class
     * Deployed to the Administration of Department of Software Engineering in SKKU

  * Project: Recovering family trees for slaves during Joseon Dynasty
     * The project was conducted by Academy of East Asian studies in SKKU; helped in
     * making a supporting tool that suggests the relations of slaves during the Joseon Dynasty
     * The researchers referred to  suggestions that were made by the supporting tool to build the family trees
     * The input was given as csv format and contained 95,000 slaves’ information, such as their master, father, and age. However, since the data referred to reports that were published over 600 years ago, most of the  input data was corrupted and removed. 
     * The frequent itemset mining method was used and the method suggested relations for approximately 9,000 ~ 10,000 slaves
